import React from 'react'

// i'm going to have two main jsx components one that shows the current delivery status of a non-delivery order, and the second will show the order history

// i will need to grab the orders, then parse out completed and unfinished orders

// the completed orders will need to be an array and then mapped over

// how do i want to update the status of the orders? a series of time intervals, that when hit will trigger a database call and update the deliveryStatus field but will also updated the react state value
