# MockDoorDash
#<strong><em>[MockDoorDash](https://mock-door-dash-a506924dcc36.herokuapp.com/)</em></strong>: An application that has been built using the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node) that simulates the user's perspective searching for food, and placing an order.

## Motivation
This project was an opportunity to deepen my understanding of React, database design, and APIs. Reverse-engineering DoorDash and implementing a similar workflow was a rewarding experience. The most challenging aspect was integrating the Google Maps API, especially since the project uses a now-deprecated version. This challenge highlighted my initial lack of experience with APIs, which was a key motivation for this project.

Through this project, I gained valuable insights into React's timing and batch updates, enhancing my comprehension of data management and manipulation in web applications.
